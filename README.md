🍗 Lechon Manok Management System

A web-based management system built using PHP and HTML, designed specifically for a Lechon Manok business.
This system helps the business owner manage sales, inventory, and staff operations while allowing staff members to securely log and report their daily sales.

📌 Project Description

The Lechon Manok Management System streamlines daily business operations by replacing manual record-keeping with a centralized digital platform.
